# TicTacToe Android

The Tic-tac-toe game for Android.
This project uses the code of my console Java version of the game [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/Roux13/tictactoe).
All classes without output/input were moved to this project.

* The app has one screen.
* The game uses standard rules for field 3 by 3.
* You can play versus human or CPU (This uses simple random CPU).
